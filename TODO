x *refactor your tests to maintain your sanity
	struct Test { char *name, _Bool run, void (*test)(args...) }[]
x *use lite for options instead of custom rolled Opt, b/c it's also long
x *remove the extra defines that draw common shapes. I don't use them anywhere else and they're ugly and they're primitives...

*tests should just be data structures too
	what is a line but { a, b, color }
	what is a circle but { pt, radius, color, fill }
	what is a triangle but { pt, pt, pt, color, fill }
	what is a rectangle but { pt, width?, height, color, fill }
	what is a polygon but { pt * } (this one admittedly, is a little harder...)
	you can test that it worked by looking and also by sampling the pixel in the surface...

*call randseed once when initializing SDL (or canvas or what the hell ever)
*use bools or ints to return tests, 
	bools to tell if things failed
	ints to return things like timing and iterations
*use a define for 
	being verbose
	drawing slow
	drawing by interrupt (both can't be enabled cleanly)
		(drawing per point isn't helpful b/c it's so slow)
	pause
*ONE line function (you've got 3 right now)
*coord is useless...
*debug your polygon fill routine

defines
=======
slow draw
interrupt draw

debug
=====
- move all of that debugging code to debug.c
- simplify line and drawing data structures... 
	all the others need a ton of points...
- print structure code either in print.c or debug.c and include with #defines...

lines
=====
when running the line algo, check that points are not greater than W - 1 (and H - 1) (a canvas thing)
lines need x & y
	the line "stuff" needs to be somewhere else though
		color, opacity, stroke, antialiasing, polygonFill or not (since the lines will change), saving points versus plotting, fills can be gradients, fills can be imaages, fills can be all other sorts of stuff...
	other option is to make a define that sets all of this stuff and it's the same data structure...
#define draw - draws to surface by replacing function pointer with plot 
#define scan - scans a line but draws later...


circles
=======
circles need one x and one y


polygons
========
When drawing polygons, the routine must start at the TOP or the BOTTOM

then, when you sort, you have to check for distance between points (but not really, b/c that's not always a sign of "convexness")

- switching to a simpler method for handling out of bounds lines
	- reject lines that will never be drawn
	- reject all points that are negative 
	- reject all points that are too large
	x use only positive distances
	- optimize vert & horiz lines
	- simplify the rejection code...


text
====
is included in SDL_TrueType, but it'd be great to figure out how to ship something small that works...


timing
======
set up a better timer (nanosleep should work)


- breaking up code into #includes is OK with mewhile we're in heavy dev


- compilation will speed up greatly if bnd[512] is not initialized at compile time.
	instead, do it at runtime within main()


display / initialization
========================
- globalize the Display Window.  The game loop (or main()) can initialize it... a
	Dis *dis=NULL; or Window *Dis=NULL;

- how to switch the window size (or resolution) on the fly?


builds
======
- xplatform builds
	android
	iOS
	Windows 7
	(Linux / SteamOS)
	TV? (are these any different?)
	Nintendo Wii
	PS4
	XBox
	HTML5 / JS (research on this one)


compression (should be in lite)
===============================
- light compression
	0-F (works for embedded maps...)
	FAAAAA0A / a super high base might do the trick
	256colors (unsigned chars work well)
	1024colors
